A modal dialog can be useful in authentication or configuration scenarios,\n * or when extra situational UI space is needed. Only one dialog can be displayed at a time per extension.\n * Inside the popup dialog window, another extension can be loaded and run. This *dialog extension* will have full access\n * to the functions provided by the Extensions API. One difference between the extension running in the popup dialog window\n * and an extension running in the dashboard is that the popup dialog window must call\n * the `initializeDialogAsync()` method instead of `initializeAsync()` to initialize the extension.\n *\n * **Note** If you want to use a popup dialog window on Tableau Server, you need to let users know that their browser must be\n *  configured to allow popups.\n */\nexport interface UI {\n  /**\n   * @param url           The url of the 'dialog extension' to navigate to in the dialog.

For example, `./config.html` or `config.html` are allowed,\n   *                      but not the root-relative path `/config.html`.\n   *                      **Note** If your extension is meant for use in versions of Tableau prior to 2019.3,\n   *                      you should use an absolute url.\n   * @param payload       The `payload` is optional, and is used to provide data to the popup dialog window\n   *                      at startup.
